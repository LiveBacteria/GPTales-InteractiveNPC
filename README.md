# GPTales-InteractiveNPCs with Cardinal System

GPTales-InteractiveNPCs is an innovative RPG Maker project that harnesses the power of OpenAI's GPT technology and the advanced Cardinal System to breathe life into the game's non-playable characters (NPCs). By integrating advanced language models and the Cardinal System, an AI-driven overseer that bridges the game engine and NPCs, this project aims to create an immersive, dynamic, and interactive world where NPCs exhibit diverse personalities, react intelligently to player interactions, and contribute to the richness of the game's narrative.

The Cardinal System observes the game state and issues contextually relevant commands to the NPCs, managing their schedules, contextual decision-making, and interactions with the player character. Players will experience a more engaging and responsive environment, as the NPCs dynamically adapt their dialogue, behaviors, and stories, shaping the game world according to each player's choices and actions. GPTales-InteractiveNPCs redefines the boundaries of RPG Maker games by offering a uniquely lifelike and captivating experience for both seasoned players and newcomers alike.
